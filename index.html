        <h2>Looking for semantic solutions?</h2>
        <p>After completing my PhD in natural language processing at the <a href="https://www.ulb.be/" target="_blank">Universit√© libre de Bruxelles</a> (ULB) in 2015, I started working as a consultant for the European Commission and eventually created my own company, <a href="http://semanticsolutions.be" target="_blank">Semantic Solutions</a>, in 2018.</p>
        <p>When not helping people to make sense of their unstructured data, I teach three classes to Master-level students: 
          Introduction to computational linguistics and Automated processing of corpora at the ULB, 
          and Information technology at the University of Geneva.</p>
